# Data Broker Opt-Out Instructions

* [Full instructions are here](https://github.com/glamrock/data-brokers/blob/master/data-brokers.md)
* [Yael Grauer's opt-out list is here](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ne9b3z/how-to-get-off-data-broker-and-people-search-sites-pipl-spokeo) -- there's some overlap of course, but hers is much larger than this one.
* [Report FTC violations here](https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/?utm_source=takeaction#crnt&panel1-1)

I've compiled a list of data aggregators, data brokers, direct marketing firms, and others who trade personal data. Many of these are very quickly dealt with via web forms, but others require a letter and a copy of a photo ID. Many of the data brokers came from my notes, but others have come from discussions with other researchers and anti-data mining projects like stopdatamining.me. All sources were fairly out of date, so I've gone through and listed the current contact info and process for each. Feel free to pass it along and let me know if there are any errors or omissions. ^_^

When you look at the list of data brokers, it's easy to get overwhelmed. If you only have a little time to spend on this, I recommend:

* Look at Spokeo.com, and ask for any records on you to be removed via their web form.
* Opt-out at the Direct Marketing Association (many companies use this list to automatically remove people). https://dmachoice.thedma.org/register.php
* Remove unused apps from your phone and social media accounts to limit data loss.

**Privacy reminder**: other than credit reporting agencies such as Equifax, no one should ask for your social security number or tax ID while opting out. When sending a copy of your ID, mark out the ID number and draw a line across the photo.

# Credit Reporting Agencies

There's not a good way to fully opt-out of credit reporting.  Get a free annual credit report via annualcreditreport.com (if you have a social security number or tax ID number). I highly recommend requesting via snail mail and requesting that errors be removed.  You can also opt-out of pre-approved credit card & loan offers, which is a common vector for identity theft.

# Online Marketing

Digital marketing firms also conduct monitoring and correlation of user
data.  This is most noticeable with "retargeting," the phenomena where
ads seem to follow you around the internet.  Opting out won't keep ads
from displaying, but helps limit retargeting and self-reinforcing ad
cycles.

Advertiser 1: You looked at dog food yesterday, so you *must* have a
dog, right? We'll show you more ads about dog food so maybe you'll buy
*our* dog food next time.
Advertiser 2: Because you're seeing lots of ads about dogfood, you must
have a dog, right?
