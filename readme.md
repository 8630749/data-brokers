I've compiled a list of data aggregators, data brokers, direct marketing firms, and others who trade personal data. Many of these are very quickly dealt with via web forms, but others require a letter and a copy of a photo ID. Many of the data brokers came from my notes, but others have come from discussions with other researchers and anti-data mining projects like [stopdatamining.me](https://www.stopdatamining.me). All sources were fairly out of date, so I've gone through and listed the current contact info and process for each. Feel free to pass it along and let me know if there are any errors or omissions. ^–^

When you look at the list of data brokers, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. If you only have a little time to spend on this, I recommend:

1. Look at [Spokeo.com](https://www.spokeo.com/), and ask for any records on you to be removed [via their web form](https://www.spokeo.com/optout).
2. Opt-out at the [Direct Marketing Association](https://dmachoice.thedma.org/register.php) (many companies use this list to automatically remove people).
3. Remove unused apps from your phone and social media accounts to limit data loss.

**Privacy reminder**: Other than credit reporting agencies such as Equifax, no one should ask for your social security number or tax ID while opting out. When sending a copy of your ID, mark out the ID number and draw a line across the photo.

### This should be an app!
I agree -- people keep flaking out on making it, so I’m likely to just make it myself at some point. If you’re interested in making the app and *won’t* put it on the back-burner for years, sent me an email.
